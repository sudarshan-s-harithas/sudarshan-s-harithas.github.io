I'm a second-year PhD student at [Brown University](https://cs.brown.edu/), advised by [Prof. Srinath Sridhar](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ssrinath/). Previously, I graduated from the [International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad (IIIT-H)](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) with an MS in Computer Science, where I worked with [Prof. K Madhava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/). 


My research focuses on developing multi-embodied policies that enable autonomous robots to acquire complex behaviors by jointly learning from their own experiences as well as from multiple other embodiments. I am interested in developing general-purpose agents to solve a variety of tasks and to robustly operate in the real world.
