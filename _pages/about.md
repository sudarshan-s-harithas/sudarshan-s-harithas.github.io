I'm a third-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.brown.edu/) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), advised by [Prof. Srinath Sridhar](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ssrinath/). Previously, I graduated from the [International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad (IIIT-H)](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) with an MS in Computer Science, where I worked with [Prof. K Madhava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/). 


Broadly, I am interested in developing general purpose robots that can actively interact with the world and perform a diverse range of tasks. Towards this goal I intend to develop cross-embodied policies that enable autonomous robots to acquire complex behaviors by jointly learning from their own experiences as well as transfer skills from multiple other embodiments. 

### 🔬 Research Focus

1. 🧠 **Embodiment-Agnostic Representations**  
   Develop representations that minimize the embodiment gap, enabling seamless transfer of manipulation and loco-manipulation skills from humans to robots such as humanoids and multi-fingered dexterous hands.

2. 🤖 **Cross-Embodied Action Generation**  
   Design architectures and learning algorithms for cross-embodiment action generation, allowing skills to generalize across diverse robot morphologies.

3. 📊 **Multi-Embodiment Data Infrastructure**  
   Build scalable data-capture infrastructure for multi-embodiment action datasets.
