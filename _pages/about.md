Hi there! I'm a second year PhD student at Brown University, supervised by Prof. Srinath Sridhar. My research focusses on developing generalist policies that enable robots to robustly operate real world. Previously, I graduated from the International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad (IIIT-H) with an MS in Computer Science, where I worked under the supervision of Prof. K Madhava Krishna.
