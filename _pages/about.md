I'm a third-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.brown.edu/) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/), advised by [Prof. Srinath Sridhar](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ssrinath/). Previously, I graduated from the [International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad (IIIT-H)](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) with an MS in Computer Science, where I worked with [Prof. K Madhava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/). 


Broadly, I am interested in developing general purpose robots that can actoively interact with the world and perform a diverse range of tasks. Towards this goal I intend to develop cross-embodied policies that enable autonomous robots to acquire complex behaviors by jointly learning from their own experiences as well as from multiple other embodiments.
